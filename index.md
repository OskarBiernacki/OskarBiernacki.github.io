# Profile

### Cybersecurity Student | Red Teaming | CTF Author | Security Tool Developer

I’m a 7th-semester Computer Science student (Cybersecurity specialization) at **PJATK Warsaw** with a strong passion for ethical hacking, web application security, and creating Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.  
I combine a hands-on approach with continuous learning to stay at the cutting edge of offensive security.
